Tasks:
----------------

- Adjust Admin.java addEmployee():
	- Currently-- when user creates a new employee, if any values are null, there is a
		nullpointerexception.
	- Adjustments will be between CreateEmployeeListener and Admin.java.
	
	- Solution ideas:
		- in the same method or in a separate one, build the string query so it only
			includes the fields/column categories that aren't null.
			- then use Admin.checkForNull() to build the preparedStatement.
		- Create Employee, add Employee to the DB using only name and surname, then 
			set DB values using fields which are not null.
			- Write method in Admin.java that adds employee using only name and surname.
			- Write method in Admin.java that returns the most recent employee ID 
				corresponding to the employee with the provided name/surname, 
				so we can obtain the ID of this newest employee.
			- then go through and add employee field values, using 
				Admin.setEmployeeData(), so long as the value is not null.
				
				
- fix edit employee for jcomboboxes which arent updating due to type checking, 
	string vs enum.
	- check resetemployee and adminUI
	
- Add a button to Add Employee page to reset the fields so you can add another new
	employee without having to exit the page and return to it to clear the fields.
